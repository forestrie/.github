Forestrie is a trust‑minimized digital provenance ledger

The software was originally created by DataTrails, Inc. as the underlay for their digital provenance platform and released under an MIT license to promote system transparency.

DataTrails was acquired by [OnID](https://onid.co/) in 2025, who continue to operate the platform.

The original software continues to be available and maintained at: <https://github.com/datatrails/>

This project (Forestrie) is an independent effort to continue the evolution of standards‑based, interoperable, and highly scalable provenance ledgers.
